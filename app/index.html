        <h2>Accommodations</h2>
        <p>We recommend looking at accommodations in the Kohala Coast area—from Waikaloa to Hawi. In Waikaloa, which is a bit farther from the wedding venue, there are a number of accommodation options, including the <a href="http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/koamc-waikoloa-beach-marriott-resort-and-spa/" target="_blank">Waikoloa Beach Marriott Resort &amp; Spa</a>, the <a href="http://www.hiltonwaikoloavillage.com" target="_blank">Hilton Waikaloa Village</a> and the <a href="http://outriggerfairwayvillascondo.com" target="_blank">Outrigger Fairway Villas</a>.</p>
        <p>There are two hotel options closer to the wedding venue in Waimea: the <a href="http://www.princeresortshawaii.com/mauna-kea-beach-hotel/" target="_blank">Mauna Kea Beach Resort</a> and the <a href="http://www.princeresortshawaii.com/hapuna-beach-prince-hotel/" target="_blank">Hapuna Beach Prince Hotel</a>. The hotels are sister properties—located next to each other—and are approximately 40 minutes from the airport.</p>
        <p>Discounted rates are available for our wedding guests at both the Mauna Kea Beach Hotel and the Hapuna Beach Prince Hotel for the room types listed below.</p>

        <p>If you're planning an extended trip to Hawaii, you may want to consider renting a condo.

        <h2>Getting There</h2>
        <h3>Where to Fly</h3>
        <p>Kona International Airport at Keahole<br>
          KOA Kailua-Kona<br>
          73-200 Kupipi Street<br>
          Kailua-Kona, HI 96740-2645
        </p>
        <p>A number of airlines provide direct flights from the continental US to KOA. Check the <a href="http://hawaii.gov/koa/airport-information/airlines-at-koa" target="_blank">airport website</a> to find your most convenient option.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>How to Drive</h3>
        <p>Once you've picked up your rental car from the Kona airport, follow these directions to find the Mauna Kea and Hapuna Prince hotels:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>As you leave the Airport, turn left onto Queen Kaahumanu Highway 19, heading toward Kawaihae.</li>
          <li>Drive north about 27 miles, approximately 30 minutes.</li>
          <li>Half-way point: after about 15 minutes you will come to a stoplight (near the Waikoloa Resort area), from this point you are half way there.</li>
          <li>2-mile landmark: look for the signs for the small town of Puako (from this turn off you are about 2 miles from the hotel entrance).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>...for Mauna Kea Beach Hotel only:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>1-mile landmark: You'll pass the state highway sign for Hapuna Beach State Park, go over the overpass and look for the entrance to Mauna Kea Beach Hotel approximately one mile past this mark.</li>
          <li>On the left side of the highway, you'll see a lava rock wall with "Mauna Kea" on the side. As you turn into the driveway, you'll approach the gatehouse and hotel staff will direct you to the hotel.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>...for Hapuna Beach Prince Hotel only:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>You'll pass the state highway sign for Hapuna Beach State Park, go over the overpass and shortly thereafter, look for the entrance to Hapuna Beach Prince Hotel – the entrance will be on the right side.</li>
          <li>Enter this driveway and the guard will direct you to the hotel, located oceanfront.</li>
        </ul>
